## Development Process

1. We discussed the project theme within the team and ultimately decided to create an e-commerce website.
2. We drew the website wireframe and defined user stories.
3. We created the data model based on the wireframe, user stories, and data flow.
4. We reported our project plan, wireframe, and data model to the instructor, and made modifications and adjustments based on the instructor's suggestions.
5. We set up the project infrastructure, including the frontend with React, the backend with Express, the database with MongoDB, and Node.
6. We assigned different pages of the website to various team members.
7. Team members aligned their project progress, troubleshot issues, pushed their branches to GitHub, resolved branch conflicts, and merged branches daily.
8. We reported the soft launch to the instructor and received feedback.
9. We made adjustments based on the instructor's feedback, mainly focusing on security and validation.
10. We gave a final presentation of our project to the instructor and classmates, and answered questions.

The biggest challenge in developing a project with the team is the Team Git Workflow. We need to maintain communication to align on what features each member is developing and approximately when they will complete their work. Frequent commits are necessary to reduce conflicts during the branch merge process.

Aside from this, team development has many benefits: team members can openly and deeply discuss ideas, wireframe, data model, and infrastructure design, which gives me a lot of inspiration. Additionally, when troubleshooting is needed, my team members help analyze the problem and try to solve it together.

We need to thank our instructors Simon and Faith for their suggestions, feedback, and assistance throughout our development process!
